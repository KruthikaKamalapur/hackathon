# Hackathon

## Overview
This repository contains multiple directories, each dedicated to a specific task. Every directory includes:
- **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)**: Contains the implementation, results, and visualizations.
- **Results**: Stored and visualized within the respective Jupyter Notebook.
- **README**: Provides a summary of the approach, architecture, and instructions for running the notebook.

## Model Architecture & Methodology
Each notebook describes the architecture used, including:
- Data preprocessing steps
- Model selection and justification
- Training methodology
- Evaluation metrics and analysis
- Challenges encountered and solutions implemented

## Visualization
All visualizations, including plots and evaluation metrics, are embedded in the respective Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset Upload (Kaggle)
For datasets stored on Kaggle:
1. Upload the dataset under the name `new-hsioa`.
2. Update the dataset path in the notebook if necessary.

## User Interface (Optional but Encouraged)
A working prototype where users can:
Input online text (tweets, comments, etc.)
View sentiment/misogyny/toxicity classification results
See highlighted words that influenced the model’s decision

it was implemented in 4th task, The prototype allows:
- Input of online text .
- Viewing sentiment, misogyny, and toxicity classification results.
- Highlighting words that influenced the model’s decision.

Each directory has a standalone setup with all necessary details included within its README file.
